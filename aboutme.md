It's nice you want to learn about me! Although I believe data is the most interesting part of this website, perhaps understanding my background can help you understand the data more:

- I love to get a little sunshine everyday, yet I always wear SPF 50+ even if I'm inside 98% of the day
- I wish I could sew really well so I could quickly create new things, but every time I start a sewing project, I regret it. I always love the results, I just don't like the process.
- I am looking forward to using more and more data in my analysis and to broaden my scope of topics. For now I mostly concentrate on health-related topics, which can be very broad.

Feel free to ask me questions over twitter if you're not sure of something here.

### my history

Growing up in the beautiful nature of Marin County was a gift. From there, I moved to Santa Barbara to attend UCSB, which was also a gorgeous scene. I took a full year abroad to the University of Bristol, which was my first international experience living abroad. I really loved the people I met while abroad. I learned how great other countries can be if I take the time to explore them. I moved to San Diego after graduation and began work as a Research Chemist in a small private lab. I worked full time while also getting my Master's in Health Policy from UCSD School of Medicine and Cal Western School of Law. I took classes at both campuses and was very influenced and impressed by the teachers on both campuses. My goal for most of my twenties was to become a doctor and help people be the healthiest version of themselves. After finishing my course work, I moved to San Francisco. Even though I lived right next door to SF as a kid, living in the city felt like a new world. I fell in love with the views, ambition of strangers and the culture of work smart and play hard. To this day I am still inspired by nearly everyone I meet, because people are doing cool things in San Francisco all the time.

I have two baby boys, ages 2.8 years and 6 months. My husband and I met in San Francisco at a costume party. Halloween has always been my favorite holiday because candy, friends and costumes. Now it's also a time to celebrate meeting my biggest inspiration of all, my husband. He still inspires me to be the best version of myself everyday, even when he **refuses** to pick up his clothes from the floor. I'll delete this last line if he starts cleaning his clothes off the floor!
